breeze-viz
=============

Visualization library backed by Breeze and JFreeChart.

See https://github.com/scalanlp/breeze/wiki/Quickstart for documentation.

I (@dlwh) would like to no longer maintain this library. If someone wants to take it over, I would be very much appreciate it! You can do whatever you want to it:
rename it, rework it, whatever. Ideally you'd keep it based on Breeze, and I can help with any problems you come across!

The current release is 0.5
